# .vscode/
Contains Visual Studio Code settings and launch configurations to streamline development:
- settings.json: Editor preferences (indentation, formatting, etc.)
- launch.json: Debugging profiles (e.g., how to build/run a C/Java program)
- extensions.json: Recommended extensions for C/C++ or Java development

If you’re using VS Code, opening the workspace here will automatically pick up these configurations.
